# LS-Introduction-to-Cryptography

Welcome to the _Introduction to Cryptography_ course brought to you by CSeC IITB as a part of Learners' Space! In this repository, you'll find relevant resources and attached links to guide you on your journey as you explore the foundations of cryptography!

We kick things off with the first section, which is an introduction to classical cryptography covering various ciphers like Caesar, Vigen√®re, and Atbash, along with encodings like Hex and Base64, highlighting their historical significance and basic cryptanalysis techniques, Head on to [Section-1](Section-1/README.md) to get started! [[Challenges](Section-1/Challenges)] <br>

Done with Section-1 ? Move on to [Section-2](Section-2/README.md) where we will explore modern cryptography covering XOR operations, One-Time Pad (OTP), essential number theory, and the RSA cryptosystem ! Try some interesting challenges here:- [[Challenges](Section-2/Challenges)] <br>

Well done going through last two sections, we will conclude with this last section which will focus on concepts including digital signatures, cryptographic hash functions, block/stream ciphers, AES encryption, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange - [Section-3](Section-3/README.md)!
